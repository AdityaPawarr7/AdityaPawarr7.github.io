# Individual Project 1

## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview

For Individual Project 1 in front-end web development, I created and deployed a personal website on GitHub.io as a professional profile. This website includes my name, headshot, contact information, resume, background, education, experiences, and skills. Additionally, I added a new HTML page to introduce the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects.
I used an open-source CSS template, specifically Bootstrap, to style my website, making it suitable for potential employers. To track page visits, I integrated Flag Counter. My website includes basic JavaScript features such as a digital clock, an analog clock, a show/hide email feature, and another functionality of my choice. I also integrated two public web APIs: the JokeAPI, which displays a new joke every minute, and WeatherAPI to show the weather in Cincinnati. Furthermore, I implemented JavaScript cookies to remember returning visitors. If it's their first visit, the website displays "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!" Otherwise, it shows "Welcome back! Your last visit was <the date/time of last visit>," with this value updating on each visit.

Through this project, I learned important skills in creating a personal portfolio, using Bootstrap for design, and using cookies to keep track of users. I also improved my ability to use JavaScript and public APIs, and in a way applying all the knowledge that we've learned in the lectures until now.

In this project, I expanded on front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on `github.io` cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements which are met as shown in the content below with screenshots.

### General requirements: 

+ Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills (25 pts).

 For this task, we followed the instructions as given in Lecture 6 slides and followed along with Professor Phung to create a new public repository named ```AdityaPawarr7.github.io``` in order to host our professional portfolio website. On top of that, I added in the experiences on my resume, my name, headshot, contact information, background, education, and skills as well.

The link for the webpage is [https://AdityaPawarr7.github.io](https://AdityaPawarr7.github.io)
 ​
+ Create a link to a new HTML page to introduce this "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects (5 pts)
 ​
### Non-technical requirements (20 pts)​

+ Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap​

_Target this profile for your potential employer, and your page will be graded as a part of your job application​_

+ Include a page tracker, for example: [https://analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/)](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/), [https://flagcounter.com/](https://flagcounter.com/).

### Technical requirements (50 pts)​

#### Basic JavaScript code (20 pts)​

+ Use jQuery and one more open-source JavaScript framework/library​ to implement JavaScript code introduced in Lab 2, including a digital clock, an analog clock, show/hide your email, and one more functionality of your choice. **(5 pts each)**

+ Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts)​
 _Ensure you include a disclaimer stating that the public/third-party services generate the generated contents below and that you are not responsible._

1. Integrate the jokeAPI ([https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any), similar to Lab 2.2.d.i) with `Any` category of joke to display a new joke in your page every 1 minute.

2. Integrate a public API with graphics and display that graphic/image in your page. Examples: [https://xkcd.com/info.0.json](https://xkcd.com/info.0.json), [https://www.weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io).

+ Use JavaScript cookies to remember the client (10 pts): If first-time visit, display the message "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!"; otherwise, display the message "Welcome back! Your last visit was <the date/time of last visit>" (ensure that you update this value <the date/time of last visit> each time the same user visits -2pts if missing).

## Report

You must write a report using Markdown format following the template/outline provided in Lecture 2 ([https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md)) which should include the course name and instructor, your name and email together with your headshot (150x150 pixels), and sub-sections of the assignment's overview, and each task and sub-task.

There should be an overview sub-section where you must write an overview of the assignment and the outcomes you learned from it. Include your website's clickable URL deployed on `github.io`. Also, include a direct clickable link to the project folder on GitHub.com so that it can be viewed when grading, for example, [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1).

For each sub-task, write a brief summary of how you completed it. You are welcome to include code snippets and screenshots to demonstrate the outcome; however, they are not required. **Please note that demo screenshots must include your name with proper captions and be visible, i.e., in high resolution, not too blurry, or with much blank space, for grading**. 

Your report must be exported in PDF with its contents and screenshots correctly rendered in proper order. The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-project1.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-project1.pdf`, and uploaded to Canvas to be submitted by the deadline. 


## Deliverables and Submission

You need to submit **three** deliverables in PDF files for grading:

+ Your report mentioned above.

+ Your deployed website printed from a browser in PDF.

+  The source code of your deployed website printed from a browser in PDF.
