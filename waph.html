		<h2> Course Description </h2>
		<p> In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

		<h2> Labs </h2>

		<p> This class consists of 4 Labs with hands-on exercises. So far we have done 2 labs and the description of the same is given below </p>

		<h3> Lab 1: </h3>

		<p> This lab has covered how to use Wireshark from recording a capture of packets to understanding what important information each packet carries and specifically through HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests(Part 1 Task 1).

For Part 1 Task 2, we learned about how to use the telnet command in our command window and to send an HTTP GET Request.

In Part 2, we started off by developing a small program in C which we deployed to the web through a CGI program- after the small program, we gave it a try on our own by writing HTML code within the print statements.

For Task 2, we developed a small piece of PHP code which projected a single statement which we deployed to the web and in the same task, we also projected our own name to the web by changing the value that data was assigned to.

For Task 3, we caputed the packets for the work we did in Task 2 (also projecting our name)- we analyzed the POST and GET packets while making use of the 'curl' command to create an HTTP POST request with our name in the data. </p>

		<h3> Lab 2: </h3>

		<p> Lab 2 dives deep into using HTML while incorporating JavaScript code into it as well. The lab consists of two main tasks with their own individual subtasks. The first task is to create a HTML webpage which contains basic information about this class while also adding our headshot and input forms into it. The second tasks consists of incorporating Ajax into the input forms, using CSS to change up the style of the webpage, and Web API Integration using the JokeAPI and Agify API.

This lab helps us prepare for individual project 1 and was extremely useful to me as I knew nothing about Ajax, CSS, & Web API Integration.</p>

		<br> </br>

		<h2> Hackathons </h2>

		<p> This class consists of 4 Individual Hackathons for which we have approximately 72 hours in order to complete the attacks. So far we have done Hackathon 1 and the description of the same is below. </p>

		<h3> Hackathon 1: </h3>

		<p> This is the first of 4 hackathons and it deals with attacking 7 different levels of webpages from 0-6 in order to show "Level #- Hacked by Aditya Pawar".

There are two tasks in this Hackathon. The first task involves the 7 different levels of webpages to attack to show the alert of being hacked by Aditya Pawar but along with this we also have to guess the source code of echo.php in order to gain better understanding about how to develop safer webpages.

In the second task, we have to put use our skills of hacking in order to fortify pieces of code that we've already written- echo.php in the first subtask and waph-pawarat-task2d.html in the second subtask. We do this by adding in input validation and input encoding to prevent attacks.

This hackathon has helped me immensely in order to gain an in-depth understanding on how exploiters target webpages by bypassing the XSS filters and will make me always account for the safety of the program that I'm developing.</p>

		<br> </br>

		<h2> Individual Projects </h2>

		<p> We have a number of Individual Projects to do as well in this class and so far we've done one and waph.html is a part of this project. </p>

		<h3> Individual Project 1: </h3>

		<p> 
For my Individual Project 1 in front-end web development, I created and deployed a personal website on GitHub.io as a professional profile. This website includes my name, headshot, contact information, resume, background, education, experiences, and skills. Additionally, I added a new HTML page to introduce the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects.

I utilized an open-source CSS template, specifically Bootstrap, to style my website, targeting it for potential employers. To track page visits, I integrated Flag Counter. My website includes basic JavaScript functionalities such as a digital clock, an analog clock, a show/hide email feature, and another functionality of my choice. I also integrated two public web APIs: the JokeAPI, which displays a new joke every minute, and WeatherAPI to display the weather in Cincinnati. Furthermore, I implemented JavaScript cookies to remember returning visitors. If it's their first visit, the website displays "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!" Otherwise, it shows "Welcome back! Your last visit was <the date/time of last visit>," with this value updating on each visit. </p>
